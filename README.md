# Hi! I'm Gloria :)

I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science and Economics. 

I am passionate about web development, full stack development, accessible computer science education, and leveraging tech for social good and tech for fun.

In my free time, I love to listen to music, make covers on Garageband, explore NYC, play video games, and learn new things. Currently, I am interested in reading various religious texts, such as the Quran, the Jewish Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Bhagavad Gita.
