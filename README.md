# Hi! I'm Gloria :)

I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science and Economics. 

I am passionate about web development, full stack development, and accessible computer science education.

In my free time, I love to listen to music, make covers on Garageband, explore NYC, and play video games. 

Feel free to contact me at gqz9592@nyu.edu! Thanks for stumbling upon my page!
