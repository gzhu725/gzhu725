# Hi! I'm Gloria :)

I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science and Economics. 

I am passionate about web development, full stack development, accessible computer science education, and leveraging tech for social good and tech for fun.

In my free time, I love to listen to music, make covers on Garageband, explore NYC, play video games, and climb trees! I also like hiking flat surfaces (emphasis on flat surfaces), and have hiked the whole height of Manhattan, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Queens!

Feel free to contact me at gqz9592@nyu.edu! Thanks for stumbling upon my page!
